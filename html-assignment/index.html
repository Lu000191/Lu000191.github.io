    <article><h1>About Me</h1></article>
    <p>Hi there. my name is Yuxuan Lu. I came from China. I have a some backgound knowledge about film befroe i came to algonquin college. I have learn how to make video from preprodaction to postprodction. I love to get my hand on those video cameras, and edit the video I filmed, so i was bit more focus on being DP and Editor.</p>
    <p>The reason i choose Interactive Dedia Design because i want more job option in future than just in film industry. Most likely those job are require more than just filming a video, they also want you to make website, motion graphic, and graphic design, that is why i am here. <abbr title="pain and dismay">Oof</abbr>, I am scared, oh i hope i didn't hit any wrong stuff after typed this far.</p>
    <p>Here is a motivational quote i found today in Jan 29<sup>th</sup> 2024. <q>The bad new is time flies. The good news is you are the pilot.</q><em>Michael Altshuler</em>.</p>
