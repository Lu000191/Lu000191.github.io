    <p>Hi there. my name is <em>Yuxuan Lu</em>. I have a some backgound knowledge about film befroe I come to algonquin college. I have learned how to make video from preprodaction to postprodction with crew. I love to get my hand on those video cameras, and edit the video I filmed. Yes, as you can see. I was bit more focus on being a <abbr title="Dirctor of Photograpgy">DP</abbr> and an Video ditor.</p>
    <p>The reason I choose Interactive Dedia Design because I want more work options in future not just in film industry. To wider my future field, I need knowladge more than just know how to filming and edit a video. That is why I am here in this program. Oof, I am scared, oh I hope I won't hit any wrong stuff to mess it up after typed this far.</p>
